## How it works

This project aims to implement a PWM generator with an adjustable duty cycle. The user enters duty cycle values via the ui_in port. The pwm_generator module creates a 50â€¯kHz PWM signal with the specified duty cycle.
## How to test

Enter a specified duty cycle value and observe the uo_out[0] port. The PWM signal should be present on this output.

## External hardware

There is no external hardware.
